I need to integrate Firebase authentication into my existing React Native spiritual app. I have already completed the Firebase console setup and have my configuration ready.

TASK: Add Firebase authentication with email/password and Google sign-in to my existing React Native app, including admin access control based on email addresses.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install all necessary Firebase dependencies
2. Create Firebase configuration files
3. Set up authentication context with login/logout functionality  
4. Implement admin access control based on email addresses
5. Update existing login screen to use Firebase auth
6. Add user state management across the app
7. Ensure authentication persists between app sessions

EXISTING APP STRUCTURE:
- Main app component: App.tsx or App.js
- Login screen: LoginScreen.tsx or similar
- Main app content: SpiritualApp.tsx or similar
- Uses React Navigation for tab navigation
- Has 5 main tabs: Quotes, Videos, Calendar, Gurudev, Admin

FIREBASE CONFIGURATION:
```javascript
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBI8--3GhLYSWJo8hVeMbwg79zlZBu9qLI",
  authDomain: "gurudarshan-app.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "gurudarshan-app",
  storageBucket: "gurudarshan-app.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "802311568887",
  appId: "1:802311568887:web:698f8c5a42cd81167842f2",
  measurementId: "G-XWKB4PQPSE"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const googleProvider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
```

ADMIN EMAIL ADDRESSES:
```javascript
const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'dhru.panicker@gmail.com',
  'dhruvandapaar@gmail.com'
];
```

AUTHENTICATION FEATURES NEEDED:
- Email/password sign-in and sign-up
- Google sign-in integration
- Automatic login persistence
- Admin access control (only admin emails see Admin tab)
- Logout functionality
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling for auth failures

STYLING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use spiritual theme colors: saffron orange (#FF6B35), warm ivory (#FDF8F3)
- Match existing app design and typography
- Responsive design for mobile screens
- Loading indicators and error messages

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Install Firebase dependencies: `npm install firebase @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
2. Create Firebase config file: `src/config/firebase.js`
3. Create admin config file: `src/config/adminConfig.js`
4. Create authentication context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
5. Update main App component to use auth context
6. Update LoginScreen with Firebase authentication
7. Add authentication checks to navigation
8. Test email/password and Google sign-in
9. Verify admin access control works
10. Test authentication persistence

Please implement this step by step, showing me the code for each file and explaining what each part does. Make sure to include proper error handling and loading states.

Replace the placeholder Firebase config and admin emails with my actual values, and ensure the authentication integrates seamlessly with my existing spiritual app structure.
